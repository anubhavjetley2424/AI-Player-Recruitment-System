# AI-Player-Recruitment-System
Data-driven player recruitment system, leveraging performance &amp; scouting data along with some other attributes to produce objective, non-speculative player valuations. This is a simulation of the real-world, using data from EA FC 24, 25 and FBREF statistical match data. 

# Goal
The goal is to produce a front-end system, that will allow user interactivity, simulating the experience of a recruitment team from professional clubs entering the type of player traits, characteristics they want in their team. The backend will dynamically generate performance and scouting indexes, and generate AI predicted market valuations for players. Highlighting suggestions for players who are undervalued based on ability, past performance and potential team fit.
